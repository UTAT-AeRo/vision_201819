# UTAT AeRo Vision 2018-2019 Repository
The central repository for Vision 2018-2019

## Welcome
Welcome! This is where we will be putting all of the code that we work on throughout the year. Most of what you need will be located inside the `src` folder. In fact, your code should be there to start with. 

## Prerequisites
This repository assumes you have Python 3 installed along with the OpenCV library and all of its prerequisites.

## Contributing
### Code
Your code should go into the [`src`](src) folder

### Python
While we encourage you to try your own languages and write the code in whatever (reasonable) language you want, we will be imposing some restrictions if you choose to use Python. *Please use Python 3 and not 2, 1, etc*. If you need any additional modules covered by `pip install`, please make sure you include it in the prerequisites file (refer below)

### Prerequisites
Using a language that isn't Python, please include *both* a _Windows (10)_ and _bash (Ubuntu compatible)_ script to install the preprequisites to run your program. For example, if my module uses JAVA, include the JAVA binary in the [`setup\windows`](setup\windows) folder and a bash script containing `apt install default-jre` in [`setup\linux`](setup\linux) folder.

### Tests
While *not mandatory*, tests always makes [continuous integration](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration) a lost easier. Feel free to dm me @timothylock if you want to learn more. :)

### Documentation
YES YOU MUST HAVE IT. Check (`src/task1/example-module/README.md`)[src/task1/example-module/README.md] for an example template.

HAVE FUN
